# Git
- git init (for initializing local project into a git repo)
- git add . (to add all files/folders in the current folder for tracking)
- git commit -m "message" (to commit the changes with a meaningful message)
- git remote add origin <repo-url> (to link the local repo with the remote repo)
- git branch -M main
- git push -u origin main (to push the local repo to the remote repo and set the upstream tracking information)



<!-- Next time you modify your files and try to commit, use this command -->
- git add . (only to add new files into track)
- git commit -am "message"
<!-- And after commiting, use this command to push -->
